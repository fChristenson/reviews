# Cypress review
Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.

## Domain 
`https://www.cypress.io`

## Highlights

## My favourite parts
* Npm install

* Snapshots are amazing
* Very usefull dom inspection tool
* Great learning test with comments
* Fixture files
* In-app dom inspection
* Test syntax very familiar with mocha and jest
* Extensible through plugins
* Easy and natural feel to writing tests
* Easy to group spec files

## My least favourite parts
* Going to actual remote domain in default test, would prefer local website
* Would prefer the chainer to have been a chained property
* Would like to have a checkbox to include several spec files in a run
* Only runs Chrome flavoured browsers
* Cross browser testing not a priority
* Arrogant remark that cross browser testing is not as important as you think it is
  - (I am sure the IE team agrees)

## Conclusion
This is the best web automation tool I have ever used no question about it.

I was up and writing tests in a manner of minutes and the documentation is
first class to say the least.

The powerfull snapshots combined with an amazing interface that let's me walk
through each step of what is happening is unrivald.

If Cypress provides the same sort of support for the other browser vendors
this should be an industry standard, nothing I have ever seen comes even close.
